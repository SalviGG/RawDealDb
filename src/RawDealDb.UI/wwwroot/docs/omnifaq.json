EXAMPLE: Classic Fireman's Carry has no reversal restrictions in its text. The Volley trait is not a reversal restriction.<br> -Reversal restrictions are strictly a property of cards. Cards and effects that modify player permissions are never reversal restrictions. EXAMPLE: Panic Grab, Backed by Smackdown GM Vickie Guerrero, and the Arm Drag portion of Enter the Dragon are not reversal restrictions.<br> -Modifications to reversals are never reversal restrictions. EXAMPLE: Get Crowd Support does not grant a reversal restriction.<br> -A card that cannot be responded to does not have a reversal restriction; losing the ability to respond does not alter what cards will reverse a card, it only alters player permissions to play those cards.<br> -Cards with conditional printed reversal restrictions have those restrictions in all zones and at all times except when going through their Timing Breakdown. During that time, the Potentiality Rule comes into play, and if the reversal restriction's condition is not met, the restriction is suppressed, in much the same way a hybrid card's other types are suppressed."

EXAMPLE: Running Lariat or Team Angle's Superstar Ability -This card has no effect if overturned while taking damage.<br> -Damage modifiers are calculated before the Over Sell effect takes place. These modifiers will affect the amount of damage taken when Over Sell is played.<br> -If Sustained Damage is already in the Ring Area, it can be Activated to reduce the amount of cards overturned for Over Sell.<br> -If Over Sell Maneuver is used against a 5D maneuver, and the player only has 3 cards left in his Arsenal, he will lose via Pinfall.<br> -The player draws up to 2 cards before the end of your opponent's turn, but he does not have to draw cards from this. Any effect that makes the player play with his hand revealed will also reveal the cards drawn from Over Sell.<br> -The player still needs to meet Fortitude costs to play this card.<br> -Over Sell may not be packed by the Two-Man Power Trip.<br> -This card may be affected by cards such as Fully Loaded and Commission-er Rules!, as it is still a Reversal card..<br> -This effect will not blank a Maneuver with the Restricted Modification Symbol on it. It will still end the opponent's turn and allow the player to draw cards after the RMS Maneuver has resolved.<br> -If a player plays Over Sell Maneuver on a Maneuver with RMS, he may not reverse the RMS Maneuver while overturning cards for Over Sell Maneuver.<br> -If a Multi Maneuver is played, a 'normal' reversal can be played such as Elbow to the Face, then Over Sell can be played.<br> -Once Over Sell Maneuver is resolved, the turn has been ended; no further effects played after a 'successfully played maneuver' such as another Over Sell Maneuver or Took That on the Chin can be used. However, There's No Holding Me Back can be activated.<br> -The blanking effect only lasts until the resolution of Over Sell Maneuver and the end of turn.<br> -The cards overturned per the text of Over Sell replace the pending damage. EXAMPLE: Over Sell Maneuver is used after Kick (5D) is played; after the card search, 5 cards are overturned from Over Sell."

There is no way to have any extra Maneuvers played with the Panic effect, apart from the one specified. This is also important for card effects such as Turn the Tide and Turn Up the Heat; Benoit's ability cannot grant a bonus to the Panic maneuver due to RMS, but it will give the accompanying maneuver +2D (or greater) if possible, since it is the second maneuver played.<br> -This is not the same as Multi. A defending player will need 2 appropriate reversals that can take care of each individual card. EXAMPLE: Panic Grab played with Clutch Onto Opponent - the opponent must have a reversal specifically for Clutch in addition to one for the Grab.<br> -If the attacking player reveals a Multi maneuver, his opponent will need 3 reversals.<br> -When playing reversal cards or effects, the defending player must state which of the two Maneuvers he is reversing. Reversals to the Maneuvers can be played/used in any order the defending player chooses.<br> -If a player plays a Panic Maneuver and the opponent has less Fortitude after playing a reversal or using a reversal effect for one of the Maneuvers, the second Maneuver is vulnerable to Backlash. (This rare circumstance can happen if he uses a card such as Garbage Can Lid.) -If only one reversal card or effect is used, that card is not considered to be reversed (and effects triggered by such are not generated) unless BOTH cards are reversed when played. EXAMPLE: Shelton Benjamin plays a Panic Grab with Wraparound Wrist Lock, but the opponent only plays Chained Heat; Shelton cannot use his Superstar Ability (reversal-related) or Activate Unbreakable Chain.<br> -If the Maneuvers become successful, any reversal effects are forgotten and each Maneuver may be reversed by overturning. Damage is now applied in the order the attacking player chooses, and must be reversed in this order while overturning.<br> -If the defending player uses a card that generates an end-of-turn effect but does not reverse the maneuver, both maneuvers resolve as normal, though any blanking effects will not affect the Panic maneuver due to RMS. Afterward, the end-of-turn effect resolves. EXAMPLE: Road to Victory or Toothless Aggression.<br> -The defending player cannot play more than one reversal against each Maneuver until they become successful. EXAMPLE: An Elbow to the Face is played but no further reversal is played; both maneuvers are now successful, and the opponent can now play Sustained Damage before overturning cards.<br> -When successful, the Panic Maneuvers will deal damage in the order of the active player's choosing.<br> -A player may play a High Risk or similar Maneuver after the Panic Maneuver resolves, based on one of the two Maneuvers, since they are both considered 'successfully played' at the same time by the text of the Panic. EXMAPLE: A Panic Maneuver and a 4D Maneuver are played, the player may play a High Risk afterwards that requires a 4D or a 3D Maneuver.<br> -If a player plays Apply Illegal Leverage after playing a Sub/Panic Grab, he can choose to copy either maneuver, since both were successfully played at the same time. If the Panic maneuver is copied, the player must be able to reveal another applicable maneuver from hand and play it with the Apply.<br> -While Maintain Hold cannot be played after Panic Grab, if Apply Illegal Leverage is played after Panic and Maintain played afterward, there is no relevant text applicable each turn.<br> -If a Multi maneuver is played with a Panic, and only one reversal is played to the Multi, that maneuver will 'remember' the reversal when cards are overturned for damage, the same way it would if played without the Panic. However, if 2 reversals are played to the Multi, but the Panic is not reversed, both maneuvers become successfully played, and 3 reversals would have to be overturned to end the turn.<br> -An opponent's Old School Psychology will not cause a discard until after the accompanying maneuver has been played with the Panic maneuver. EXAMPLE: Panic Grab is played and the only card in hand is a Ankle Lock, but text of Panic Grab will force the Ankle Lock to be played with the Panic Grab before the effects of any copies of Old School Psychology."
